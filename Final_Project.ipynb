    "### Aim of project\n",
    "The main aim of the project is to meet the needs of somebody who is not sure about how they should go about investing. The main aim is to allow the user to create portfolios and view their performance to gain familiarity with the fluctuations and get a suggestion on how they should invest their money in their portfolio. The secondary aim is to create an alert system to advise the user what to do when there is a pattern found in the stock data.\n",
    "### Brief overview of how code works\n",
    "There are 3 main sections of code. The first being the optimal portfolio class where portfolios can be created, edited, viewed and selected leading to the optimisation of the portfolio given constraints. The code also includes a way to visualise the selected portfolio stocks. There is the alert system code that takes an instance from the selection of a portfolio and runs the alert system with that portfolio where the performance of the performance is compared to the previous days open and close prices. This results in alerts at a certain time giving updates on the stocks performance recently. There are also main menu functions which just give the user a way of naviagting the different tools with different functions called with diferent options selected.\n",
    "### Design decisions made in structuring of the code\n",
    "Structured the code into 3 main sections with a portfolio class so it can be run multiple times with attributes for different instances. Then for the alert system and main menu functions were created as classes are not needed.\n",
    "### How you would improve / develop the code if given more time\n",
    "Discussed within individual sections. However, an overall improvement that could have been made is the debugging process. I decided to put print statements in between lines of code to determine where the flow may stop and works. I also just made sure to test different inputs along with the same inputs to make sure the output is the same. This is fine for me but maybe using some sort of test system may be beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The alert system does not work as intended as running it after selecting whihc portfolio the tracking starts but I am not sure how to come back to the main menu as it will run forever and run te function at 9am. Therefore all other functions run as intended but the alter system portfolio selection leads to the stopping of the program. "

    "Overall, there are functions that contribute to the creation, editing, viewing and optimisation of portfolios. The functions interact with eachother and called in the main menu functions creating a flow. The way the code worksis explained in the comments. Much of the structure of the calculations for the optimization was heavily inspired from Ryan O'Connell and his youtube video, the 1st reference. If given more time I would have liked to implement different and more complex algorithms with the user getting suggestions from them with an explanation of the algorithms pros and cons so they have a broader view on the potential of their portfolio. A check for if the stock symbol entered is valid would be an improvement."

All other functions work and the alert system works if run straight away but as it is a tracking system so wanted to run it the whole time but didn't know how to run it the whole time but also interact with the system once run. Decided to change it to run straight away with the scheduler code commented out just to make the code still runa dn the email will send on command with an update but this is not what I wanted."
