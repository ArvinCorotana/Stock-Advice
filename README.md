# Stock-Advice

Allowing the user to input their stocks, considering their budget, the system will advise how much to allocate to each stock based on past performance (with visualisation) with the number of years considered and maximum allocation to one being user defined. This advice is based on the SLSQP algorithm. The system can also send updates on the stocks based on bearish and bullish dynamics or telling them of no changes via email.
